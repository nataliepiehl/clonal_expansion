# An exploration of clonal expansion models

Natalie Piehl's rotation project in the Goyal Lab from Fall 2023.

Two models are explored in this repo:

`birth_death_process` = A simple birth-death process model, copied with slight modification from a [UF Physics walkthrough](https://cmp.phys.ufl.edu/PHZ4710/files/unit3/birth-death.html)

`hierarchal_neutral_competition` = A model which incorporates the classic hierarchal model and neutral competition model, permitting intermediate states. Evaluations of different parameter sets using RMSE and KS distance were performed as well as an attempt to incorporate division memory. This code was copied with slight modification from the [source publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-04218-7).
